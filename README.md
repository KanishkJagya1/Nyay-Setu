**Nyay Setu User Manual for Beginners**


Welcome to Nyay Setu, your essential legal support app. This user manual will guide you through using the app from registration to accessing key features. Let's take a closer look at each section of the app:

**1. Registration/Login(via OTP on the registered mobile number):**

Imagine you're a guardian of an undertrial prisoner in India. To use Nyay Setu, you first need to register your account to verify your Indian citizenship. Simply provide your Aadhar Card details during registration. This ensures that only Indian citizens can access the app and its features.

**2. Home Page Overview:**

Once you've successfully registered and logged in, you'll land on the Home Page. This page is like the hub of the app, giving you access to all the key features.

**Home Page Components:**

- **Case Profile**: Here, you can think of your Case Profile as a digital dossier for the undertrial prisoner. You can view and update personal information, such as the prisoner's name, age, and case details.

- **Navigation Tabs**: Think of these tabs as quick shortcuts to different sections of the app, like tabs on a web browser.

**3. Court Status:**

Let's say you want to know the latest developments in the undertrial prisoner's case. Click on the "Court Status" tab. It's like opening a news feed dedicated to your case. You'll see real-time updates, like "Case hearing scheduled for November 10th" or "Case adjourned to December 5th." The status indicator is like a countdown clock, showing you how many days are left until the next trial date.

Also the Guardian will be able to view the details of the case (all the paper work required) from the admin side i.e. The designated Lawyer verified by us. Another important feature of this app is the status indicator, this status indicator is an important component as many of the people do not have proper exposure to the world of law and justice. They are unknown to the fact that most of the cases in India are a fixed length time dependent trial and that is where our app's Status indicator helps by providing information about the trial length on regular basis. For example a person is undertrial for commiting a severe crime of kidnapping, the average sentence for kidnapping is around 5 years then the trial cannot continue for more than 2 years. In this case the person is eligible to raise this point in the court and the judgement may be amended on the basis of this.

**4. Legal Aid:**

If you need legal support for the case, the "Legal Aid" tab is your go-to. It's like having a directory of lawyers and NGOs at your fingertips. You can find suitable lawyers for your case, connect with them, and even get support from NGOs. It's like having a legal support network right in your pocket.
Private lawyers may be available at the subscription model that our app provides.
Don't have subscription still, Don't worry we are here to provide you with support via help of Non Profit Government Organizations(NGOs) or avail public lawyers with a very minimal fees.

**5. Health Status Tracking:**

Imagine you want to ensure the well-being of the undertrial prisoner during this stressful time. The "Health Status Tracking" tab lets you do just that. It's like having a virtual health monitor for the prisoner. You can see their health statistics and track any changes over time using the SCL-90 assessment tool.

The Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) is a widely used psychological assessment tool designed to measure various psychological symptoms and distress in individuals. It consists of 90 questions grouped into nine primary symptom dimensions. Respondents rate the severity of each symptom on a scale from "0" (not at all) to "4" (extremely) based on their experiences over a specific period, often the past week.

The SCL-90 helps mental health professionals assess an individual's psychological well-being and identify symptoms of distress or psychopathology. It's valuable for screening mental health issues, monitoring changes in a person's psychological state, and tailoring treatment plans.

The nine primary symptom dimensions in the SCL-90 are somatization (physical symptoms), obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. Elevated scores in specific dimensions indicate the presence and severity of related symptoms. Higher scores suggest more pronounced distress in those particular areas.

Mental health professionals use the SCL-90 to diagnose mental health conditions, track treatment progress, and identify areas of concern. It provides valuable insights into an individual's psychological state and helps deliver appropriate care.


**6. Library:**

The "Library" tab in the Nyay Setu app is a valuable resource for users seeking legal information. Think of it as a digital library filled with materials on criminal and civil charges, laws, and legal procedures. 

Within this tab, users can access a wealth of legal resources, including articles, documents, and guides. It offers insights into various legal topics, making it an educational tool for individuals navigating the legal system. 

Users can learn about different types of criminal and civil charges, understand laws and regulations, and gain knowledge about legal procedures. It simplifies complex legal concepts, empowering users to make informed decisions during legal proceedings.

The "Library" is user-friendly and acts like a legal encyclopedia that's easily accessible. It ensures that users have essential legal information at their fingertips, making the legal landscape more understandable and manageable for all.

**7. Stare Decisis:**

You might be curious about the outcomes of cases similar to yours. The "Stare Decisis" tab is like a visual history book of past cases. It provides graphical representations of verdicts in similar cases, giving you insights into the legal landscape and what you can expect.

**8. LawBOT:**

If you have questions about the legal process, the "LawBOT" is here to help. It's like having a knowledgeable friend who can answer your legal queries. Ask questions like, "What happens during a trial?" or "What are my rights as a guardian?"

Nyay Setu also offers an admin user flow for lawyers, ensuring that they stay informed about user and case information, hearing dates, and any alarms set in the status indicator. This way, the lawyer can provide the best possible legal support to you and the undertrial prisoner.
